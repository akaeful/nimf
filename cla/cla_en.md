# HamoniKR Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This document is the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that all contributors to the HamoniKR Project must sign. By signing this document, contributors agree to the following terms regarding their contributions to the HamoniKR software.

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with any contribution made by individuals or entities, the HamoniKR Project requires each contributor to sign a CLA. This CLA indicates agreement to the following licensing terms. This license is for the protection of both the contributor and the HamoniKR Project and does not change your right to use your contributions for other purposes.

You agree to the following terms for any contributions you make to HamoniKR, now and in the future. You retain all rights, title, and interest in your contributions, except for the license granted to users of the software distributed by HamoniKR.

## 1. Definition of Project and Contributor

In this document, "Project" refers to HamoniKR, and "Contributor" refers to any individual or entity that contributes code, documentation, or other materials to the Project. In the case of a corporation, the corporation and all its subsidiaries or affiliates that control or are controlled by it are considered a single contributor.

## 2. Contributor Rights and Use of Contributions

"Contribution" refers to any original work of authorship intentionally submitted by you to the HamoniKR Project for inclusion in or documentation of any product owned or managed by HamoniKR.

You retain the rights to your contributions and are free to use them for other projects or purposes. The HamoniKR Project is granted the rights to freely use the contributions for purposes related to the Project.

You represent that each of your contributions is your original creation. You further represent that, to your knowledge, any third-party licenses or restrictions (including related patents and trademarks) affecting any part of your contribution are fully disclosed.

## 3. Patent License

If your contribution includes patents, you grant the HamoniKR Project a perpetual patent license to use those patents in the Project. If a lawsuit is filed claiming that your contribution or a work incorporating your contribution infringes a patent, the patent license granted herein will terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

If your employer retains rights to intellectual property you create, including your contributions, you represent that you are authorized to contribute on behalf of your employer, or that your employer has waived its rights concerning your contributions to the HamoniKR Project.

## 4. Submission of Non-Original Works

If you submit non-original works, you must clearly specify the license of the original author and submit a separate file. All non-original works must be approved by the original author before submission.

## 5. Signature and Submission Process

To sign this CLA, you must follow the automated process provided by GitHub. The CLA verification process is automatically initiated when you create a Pull Request (PR), and the CLA must be signed for the first contribution. The signing process is handled automatically by GitHub Actions.

If the signature process is not completed, your PR will not be reviewed, and you will need to complete the signature before proceeding.

For further information regarding the CLA signing process, please contact root@hamonikr.org.

## 6. No Obligation for Post-Contribution Support

You are not required to provide support for your contributions, as this is entirely optional. You are not obligated to offer additional support unless requested by the HamoniKR Project.

You agree to notify the HamoniKR Project if you become aware that any of the representations you made may be inaccurate in any respect.
